# Database Project 2
 
# Thomas's Thoughts and getting started.
**He said we would need**
- MySQL Community Server
- Connector/J
- Workbench

Turns out you don't need workbench. That's for the non cmdline folks

Install the github from [Here](github.com/datacharmer/test_db)
 

 My boi. That tutorial Sucked. Get the MySQL stuff downloaded on your computer. The tutorial commands may not work. Use ChatGPT to debug them. 

 (Here is a text version of the file structure in case you need to explain what the project looks like to a friend who only speaks binary :)
