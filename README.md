# Thomas's Thoughts and getting started.
**He said we would need**
- MySQL Community Server
- Connector/J
- Workbench

Turns out you don't need workbench. That's for the non cmdline folks

Install the github from [Here](github.com/datacharmer/test_db)


    
# How to run this
Connector J is already installed in the lib folder so you don't need to worry about that at all. You may however need to delete the entire mysql-connector-j-9.0.0 DIRECTORY (not the jar file please) in order to get the program to run

then you are going to need MySQL community server downloaded on your computer
- follow the tutorial and create a database on your computer using the text_db-master folder
    - If that doesn't make sense, follow the tutorial and it should make sense as you go. Basically populate your database using the github repo on your computer

Run the java program
Input your database password
Select your query
